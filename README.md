## Short Bio

I am a PhD candidate in statistics at <span style="color:black">[Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science](https://uwaterloo.ca/statistics-and-actuarial-science/)</span> of [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). I obtained my Master of Science in Statistics from [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) of [The University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) and my Bachelor of Science from [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/).

I have solid knowledge background and application skills in quantitative analysis and machine learning. I also have abundant experience with high-dimensional data analysis and time series, as well as high performance scientific computing involving GPU acceleration and parallelization. I am looking for an internship where I can work on challenging projects in data mining, machine learning, and statistical modeling modeling.
